# Cryptocurrency Conversion Application

## Overview

This applicatio provides a service for cryptocurrency conversion.
It uses Express.js as the server framework and MongoDB for data storage.
This API also saves the available cryptocurrencies every hour in database to avoid calling the external API multiple times.
Also provides functionality to get the list of companies holding the currency.

## Running the Application in Docker

### Docker ce

1. Clone the repository - same as above
2. Build the Docker image
3. Configure the environment variables - same as above
4. Run the Docker container

```bash
docker build -t crypto_converter .
docker run -d --env-file .env -p 8080:3000 --name crypto_converter-1 crypto_converter
```

5. Check the health of the API

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                        PORTS                     NAMES

```

6. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`
7. Stop and remove the container after use

```bash
docker stop crypto_converter-1
docker rm crypto_converter-1
```

## Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository - same as above
2. Configure the environment variables - according to the `docker-compose.yaml` [file](docker-compose.yaml)
